# Use lead time in PAGASA’s TCWS to reduce class suspensions and learning loss

Magandang araw!

The Department of Education's Order No. 37, series of 2022, needs urgent review, specifically its provision on automatic class suspensions due to Tropical Cyclone Wind Signals (TCWS). 
This order automatically suspends classes up to the Grade 12 level in areas placed under any TCWS, even Signal #1. 
While intended to ensure student safety during weather disturbances,  its implementation may be causing unnecessary disruptions to our children's education.

As an educator and parent, I've observed how each school day is vital for our students' learning journey. 
Missing classes affects academic progress, disrupts the learning rhythm, impacts working parents' schedules, and can lead to learning losses over time. 
This is particularly crucial as we're still recovering from pandemic-related educational setbacks.

Let's examine DOST-PAGASA's Tropical Cyclone Wind Signal (TCWS) system more closely. 
While lead time has always been a component of PAGASA's wind signals, this critical feature seems underutilized in policy-making. 
Lead time means when TCWS #1 is first raised, the expected strong winds won't arrive for at least 36 hours. 
For example, if TCWS #1 is declared at 5am today, the wind threat won't materialize until at least 5pm tomorrow. 
Under the current DepEd order, this results in immediate class suspension – potentially losing one or two full school days before any actual weather threat exists.
While early warning is crucial for preparation, such a long automatic suspension period may be unnecessary. 
The scientific basis of PAGASA's lead time system should allow us to better balance safety with educational continuity.

Therefore, I propose:
- DepEd should revise DO37 to implement class suspensions 12 or 24 hours after TCWS #1 is first raised, rather than immediately.
- LGUs or DepEd Division offices should track the initial TCWS #1 announcement time and declare the suspensions accordingly.
- DOST-PAGASA should continue educating the public about lead times in their TCWS, helping stakeholders maximize this key element in the warning.
- DOST-PAGASA should have a mechanism to communicate changes in the lead time (e.g., the threat is expected to arrive earlier than expected); LGUs and DepEd Division offices should have a mechanism to respond to such changes. 

These changes would help ensure our children's safety, and preserve their valuable learning time. 
It's important to note that this proposal focuses solely on the TCWS provision of DO37. 
Other conditions specified in the order, such as rainfall intensity and flooding, should also be considered to have a more holistic view of the potential hazards.

I welcome further discussion on this proposal.
